abstract = {Introduction: Pulmonary microbiome composition can predict future exacerbations in bronchiectasis (Rogers G.B., et al. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2014). To date, most data in this field is derived from Caucasian populations and focuses primarily on the bacterial component of the microbiome (the bacteriome). Consequently little data is available in Asian cohorts, and the fungal component of the microbiome (the mycobiome) is infrequently reported (Chotirmall S., et al. Respirology. 2017).Methods: We prospectively recruited n=59 patients with stable bronchiectasis at three separate clinical sites across Singapore. To determine the bacteriome and mycobiome in patient sputum, we performed shotgun sequencing of 16S rRNA and 18S ITS amplicons respectively. We investigated the correlation between observed microbiome architecture and clinical disease markers in our cohort.Results: Microbiome analysis of our Asian cohort revealed a distinct microbiome in bronchiectasis. The Asian bacteriome was dominated by taxa belonging to Streptococcus, Haemophilus and Pseudomonas species. The bronchiectatic mycobiome was characterised by the predominance of Candida spp. Aspergillus fumigatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Conclusion: Our findings represent the first characterisation of the Asian pulmonary microbiome in bronchiectasis, including analysis of the bacterial and fungal microbiota. The direct and mechanistic implications of these findings on clinical disease, in comparison to Caucasian cohorts, require further investigation.Funding: This research is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health{\textquoteright}s National Medical Research Council under its Transition Award (NMRC/TA/0048/2016) (S.H.C).FootnotesThis abstract was amended on 2 March 2018 to correct an error in the author list.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Understanding the composition and clinical importance of the fungal mycobiome was recently identified as a key topic in a {\textquotedblleft}research priorities{\textquotedblright} consensus statement for bronchiectasis Methods: Patients were recruited as part of the CAMEB study: an international multicentre cross-sectional Cohort of Asian and Matched European Bronchiectasis patients. The mycobiome was determined in 238 patients by targeted amplicon shotgun sequencing of the 18S-28S rRNA internally transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2. Specific qPCR for detection of and conidial quantification for a range of airway Aspergillus species was performed. Sputum galactomannan, Aspergillus-specific IgE, IgG and Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine levels were measured systemically and associated to clinical outcomes. Results: The bronchiectasis mycobiome is distinct, and characterised by specific fungal genera including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Clavispora. A. fumigatus (in Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and A. terreus (in Dundee) dominated profiles, the latter associating with exacerbations. High frequencies of Aspergillus-associated disease including sensitization and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were detected. Each revealed distinct mycobiome profiles and associated with more severe disease, poorer pulmonary function and increased exacerbations. Conclusion: The pulmonary mycobiome is of clinical relevance in bronchiectasis. Screening for Aspergillus-associated disease should be considered even in apparently stable patients.FootnotesThis manuscript has recently been accepted for publication in the European Respiratory Journal.

abstract="Bronchiectasis has an increasing profile within respiratory medicine. This chronic and irreversible airways disease is common but suffers from a lack of evidenced based therapy for patients and, a lack of understanding of its inherent heterogeneity. Research focused on bronchiectasis must therefore be prioritized if we are to adequately address this evolving clinical problem. This special issue on bronchiectasis focuses on its clinical, microbiological and therapeutic aspects. By bringing together a unique collection of original research and review articles, we hope this issue will showcase international research efforts, encourage future research collaborations and stimulate debate. In doing so, we hope to bring greater attention to the urgent need for sustained investment into focused, dedicated and collaborative research platforms in bronchiectasis, an emerging ``global epidemic''.",

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

However, culture-independent techniques report that large numbers of microorganisms coexist in the lung. There are many unknown aspects in the field, but available reports show that the lower respiratory tract microbiota: 1) is similar in healthy subjects to the oropharyngeal microbiota and dominated by members of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla; 2) shows changes in smokers and well-defined differences in chronic respiratory diseases, although the temporal and spatial kinetics of these changes are only partially known; and 3) shows relatively abundant non-cultivable bacteria in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, with specific patterns for each disease. In all of these diseases, a loss of diversity, paralleled by an over-representation of Proteobacteria (dysbiosis), has been related to disease severity and exacerbations. However, it is unknown whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of the damage to bronchoalveolar surfaces.Finally, little is known about bacterial functionality and the interactions between viruses, fungi and bacteria. It is expected that future research in bacterial gene expressions, metagenomics longitudinal analysis and host-microbiome animal models will help to move towards targeted microbiome interventions in respiratory diseases.},

  abstract    = {Defining subtypes of complex diseases such as cancer and stratifying patient groups with the same disease but different subtypes for targeted treatments is important for personalized and precision medicine. Approaches that incorporate multi-omic data are more advantageous to those using only one data type for patient clustering and disease subtype discovery. However, it is challenging to integrate multi-omic data as they are heterogeneous and noisy. In this paper, we present Affinity Network Fusion (ANF) to integrate multi-omic data for patient clustering. ANF first constructs patient affinity networks for each omic data type, and then calculates a fused network for spectral clustering. We applied ANF to a processed harmonized cancer dataset downloaded from GDC data portal consisting of 2193 patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct disease types. Moreover, we developed a semi-supervised model combining ANF and neural network for few-shot learning. In several cases, the model can achieve greater than 90% acccuracy on test set with training less than 1% of the data. This demonstrates the power of ANF in learning a good representation of patients, and shows the great potential of semi-supervised learning in cancer patient clustering.},
